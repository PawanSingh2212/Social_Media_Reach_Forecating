# Social_Media_Reach_Forecating
Social Media reach analysis an Forecasting using Time-Series techniques


#### This project dives into the analysis and forecasting of Instagram reach, leveraging time series analysis techniques.

##### Objective:
- To analyze Instagram reach data to uncover trends, seasonality, and patterns.
- To prepare the dataset for predictive modeling, enabling accurate forecasting of future Instagram reach metrics.

###### Steps Involved:
1.Data Loading and Preprocessing:
- The dataset, containing daily Instagram reach metrics, is imported using pandas.
- Encoding adjustments (e.g., encoding='latin-1') ensure smooth reading of non-ASCII characters.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualizations like line charts and scatter plots are used to explore the time series data.
- Trends in reach and variations over time are highlighted.

3.Time Series Decomposition:
- The time series is decomposed into three components using the seasonal_decompose function:
- Trend: Identifies the overall growth or decline in reach over time.
- Seasonality: Captures repeating patterns (e.g., weekly or monthly).
- Residuals: Represents noise or unexplained variations.
- Results are visualized in a multi-panel plot.

4.Autocorrelation Analysis:

- The autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots are generated to identify significant lags.
- Insights from ACF and PACF help determine parameters p, d, and ùëû for ARIMA modeling:
  p: Number of autoregressive terms.
  d: Differencing required to make the series stationary.
  q: Number of moving average terms.

5.Stationarity Testing:
- Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is used to verify if the time series is stationary.
- If the series is non-stationary, differencing techniques are applied.

6.Forecasting Model Preparation:
- Based on insights from decomposition, ACF, and PACF plots, forecasting models like ARIMA are prepared.
- Seasonal patterns and trends are incorporated for better accuracy.

7.Future Reach Prediction:
- The finalized model is used to predict Instagram reach for upcoming days or weeks.
- Forecasting results are validated with metrics like RMSE or MAE.

#### Key Results:
- A deeper understanding of the factors driving Instagram reach.
- Identification of potential trends and patterns to optimize Instagram strategy.
- A predictive model to forecast future reach and plan social media campaigns effectively.

##### Applications:
- Helps businesses and influencers plan Instagram content strategy.
- Provides data-driven insights for optimizing engagement and maximizing audience reach.
- Predictive modeling aids in resource allocation and campaign planning.
